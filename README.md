LibertyCord has been abandoned in favor of [Velocity](https://github.com/astei/velocity).

Velocity has all the same goals as the original LibertyCord and then some. Unlike LibertyCord,
which attempted to work from the BungeeCord codebase, Velocity is a totally new codebase without
all the warts that BungeeCord's engineering has. It's built on the same strong foundation that
BungeeCord uses such as Netty, but extends it further.

Velocity remains under active development, but it will eventually meet LibertyCord's goals more
closely than LibertyCord ever could.
